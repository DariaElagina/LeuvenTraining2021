Text Encoding in the Project Beta Maṣāḥǝft: Daria Elagina

London, British Library, add 19343: http://www.bl.uk/manuscripts/Viewer.aspx?ref=add_ms_19343_fs001r
Link to the BM Guidelines: https://betamasaheft.eu/Guidelines/
Link to the Guidelines on text encoding: https://betamasaheft.eu/Guidelines/?q=gap&id=text-encoding
Tasks:
1.	Let’s discuss what might be possible/important to encode in a digital edition of that text!
2.	Try to encode several lines of text using <lb/> and <gap/> elements if needed. Find out how to encode the number of words/letters which are illegible.
3.	Try to find out in the Guidelines how to mark up a place name (Alexandria). Search for that place name in the app (https://betamasaheft.eu/) and mark it up in the text.
4.	Try to find out how to mark up the date in the text.
5.	Continue text encoding, or go through the manuscript to find some specific features you want to encode and try to find a solution for that.
